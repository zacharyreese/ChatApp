# ChatApp
Local network chat application

# Purpose

To communicate with multiple devices over the same subnet. Messages are sent using a clinet and server. The client first joins the chat room using a server socket via IP address, and then sends a message to the server, which broadcasts the message to each client connected to the chat room. This application supports multiple treads allowing multiple users on one device.
